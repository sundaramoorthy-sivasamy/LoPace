## The Problem: Storage Challenges with Large Prompts

When building LLM applications, storing prompts efficiently becomes a critical challenge, especially as you scale:

- **💾 Massive Storage Overhead**: Large system prompts, context windows, and conversation histories consume significant database space. For applications serving thousands of users with multiple LLM calls, this translates to gigabytes or terabytes of storage requirements.

- **🚀 Performance Bottlenecks**: Storing uncompressed prompts increases database size, slows down queries, and increases I/O operations. As your user base grows, retrieval and storage operations become progressively slower.

- **💰 Cost Implications**: Larger databases mean higher cloud storage costs, increased backup times, and more expensive infrastructure. With LLM applications handling millions of prompts, these costs compound rapidly.

- **⚡ Latency Issues**: Loading large prompts from storage adds latency to your application. Multiple LLM calls per user session multiply this problem, creating noticeable delays in response times.

## The Solution: LoPace Compression Engine

LoPace solves these challenges by providing **lossless compression** that dramatically reduces storage requirements while maintaining fast compression and decompression speeds:

- **📉 Up to 80% Space Reduction**: The hybrid compression method can reduce prompt storage by 70-80% on average, meaning you store 5x less data while maintaining perfect fidelity.

- **⚡ Fast Processing**: Achieve 50-200 MB/s compression throughput with sub-linear scaling. Decompression is even faster (100-500 MB/s), ensuring minimal impact on application latency.

- **✅ 100% Lossless**: Perfect reconstruction guarantees your prompts are identical to the original - no data loss, no corruption, no compromises.

- **🎯 Production-Ready**: Optimized for database storage with minimal memory footprint (under 10 MB for typical use cases) and excellent scalability for millions of prompts.

Whether you're storing system prompts for thousands of users, maintaining conversation histories, or caching LLM interactions, LoPace helps you optimize storage costs and improve performance without sacrificing data integrity.

## Features

- 🚀 **Three Compression Methods**:
  - **Zstd**: Dictionary-based compression using Zstandard algorithm
  - **Token**: Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenization with binary packing
  - **Hybrid**: Combination of tokenization and Zstd (best compression ratio)

- ✅ **Lossless**: Perfect reconstruction of original prompts
- 📊 **Compression Statistics**: Analyze compression ratios and space savings
- 🔧 **Simple API**: Easy-to-use interface for all compression methods
- 🎯 **Database-Ready**: Optimized for storing prompts in databases

## Installation

```bash
pip install lopace
```

### Dependencies

- `zstandard>=0.22.0` - For Zstd compression
- `tiktoken>=0.5.0` - For BPE tokenization

## Quick Start

```python
from lopace import PromptCompressor, CompressionMethod

# Initialize compressor
compressor = PromptCompressor(model="cl100k_base", zstd_level=15)

# Your prompt
prompt = "You are a helpful AI assistant..."

# Compress using hybrid method (recommended)
compressed = compressor.compress(prompt, CompressionMethod.HYBRID)

# Decompress back to original
original = compressor.decompress(compressed, CompressionMethod.HYBRID)

# Verify losslessness
assert original == prompt  # ✓ True
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Compression/Decompression

```python
from lopace import PromptCompressor, CompressionMethod

compressor = PromptCompressor()

# Compress and return both original and compressed
original, compressed = compressor.compress_and_return_both(
    "Your prompt here",
    CompressionMethod.HYBRID
)

# Decompress
recovered = compressor.decompress(compressed, CompressionMethod.HYBRID)
```

### Using Different Methods

```python
compressor = PromptCompressor()

prompt = "Your system prompt here..."

# Method 1: Zstd only
zstd_compressed = compressor.compress_zstd(prompt)
zstd_decompressed = compressor.decompress_zstd(zstd_compressed)

# Method 2: Token-based (BPE)
token_compressed = compressor.compress_token(prompt)
token_decompressed = compressor.decompress_token(token_compressed)

# Method 3: Hybrid (recommended - best compression)
hybrid_compressed = compressor.compress_hybrid(prompt)
hybrid_decompressed = compressor.decompress_hybrid(hybrid_compressed)
```

### Get Compression Statistics

```python
compressor = PromptCompressor()
prompt = "Your long system prompt..."

# Get stats for all methods
stats = compressor.get_compression_stats(prompt)

print(f"Original Size: {stats['original_size_bytes']} bytes")
print(f"Original Tokens: {stats['original_size_tokens']}")

for method, method_stats in stats['methods'].items():
    print(f"\n{method}:")
    print(f"  Compressed: {method_stats['compressed_size_bytes']} bytes")
    print(f"  Space Saved: {method_stats['space_saved_percent']:.2f}%")
```

## Compression Methods Explained

### 1. Zstd Compression

Uses Zstandard's dictionary-based algorithm to find repeated patterns and replace them with shorter references.

**Best for**: General text compression, when tokenization overhead is not needed.

```python
compressed = compressor.compress_zstd(prompt)
original = compressor.decompress_zstd(compressed)
```

### 2. Token-Based Compression

Uses Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) to convert text to token IDs, then packs them as binary data.

**Best for**: When you need token IDs anyway, or when working with LLM tokenizers.

```python
compressed = compressor.compress_token(prompt)
original = compressor.decompress_token(compressed)
```

### 3. Hybrid Compression (Recommended)

Combines tokenization and Zstd compression for maximum efficiency:

1. Tokenizes text to reduce redundancy
2. Packs tokens as binary (2 bytes per token)
3. Applies Zstd compression on the binary data

**Best for**: Database storage where maximum compression is needed.

```python
compressed = compressor.compress_hybrid(prompt)
original = compressor.decompress_hybrid(compressed)
```

## API Reference

### `PromptCompressor`

Main compressor class.

#### Constructor

```python
PromptCompressor(
    model: str = "cl100k_base",
    zstd_level: int = 15
)
```

**Parameters:**
- `model`: Tokenizer model name (default: `"cl100k_base"`)
  - Options: `"cl100k_base"`, `"p50k_base"`, `"r50k_base"`, `"gpt2"`, etc.
- `zstd_level`: Zstd compression level 1-22 (default: `15`)
  - Higher = better compression but slower

#### Methods

##### `compress(text: str, method: CompressionMethod) -> bytes`

Compress a prompt using the specified method.

##### `decompress(compressed_data: bytes, method: CompressionMethod) -> str`

Decompress a compressed prompt.

##### `compress_and_return_both(text: str, method: CompressionMethod) -> Tuple[str, bytes]`

Compress and return both original and compressed versions.

##### `get_compression_stats(text: str, method: Optional[CompressionMethod]) -> dict`

Get detailed compression statistics for analysis.

### `CompressionMethod`

Enumeration of available compression methods:

- `CompressionMethod.ZSTD` - Zstandard compression
- `CompressionMethod.TOKEN` - Token-based compression
- `CompressionMethod.HYBRID` - Hybrid compression (recommended)

## How It Works

### Compression Pipeline (Hybrid Method)

![Compression Pipeline](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/connectaman/LoPace/main/screenshots/compression-pipeline.png)

### Why Hybrid is Best for Databases

1. **Searchability**: Token IDs can be searched without full decompression
2. **Consistency**: Fixed tokenizer ensures stable compression ratios
3. **Efficiency**: Maximum space savings for millions of prompts

## Example Output

```python
# Original prompt: 500 bytes
# After compression:
#   Zstd: 180 bytes (64% space saved)
#   Token: 240 bytes (52% space saved)
#   Hybrid: 120 bytes (76% space saved) ← Best!
```

## Development

### Setup Development Environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amanulla/lopace.git
cd lopace
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

### Versioning & Releasing

LoPace uses [setuptools-scm](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools_scm) so the package version is **derived from Git tags** — no manual edits to `setup.py` or `pyproject.toml` are needed.

**To release a new version:**

1. Bump the version by creating and pushing a tag (e.g. `v0.1.5`):
   ```bash
   git tag v0.1.5
   git push origin v0.1.5
   ```
2. CI builds the package with that version and publishes to PyPI.

The version in `lopace.__version__` (and the built distribution) comes from the latest tag. Without a tag, you get a dev version like `0.1.5.dev3+gabc1234`.

**Will the next push to `main` build 0.1.4?** No. If the latest tag is `v0.1.4` and you push new commits to `main` without a new tag, setuptools-scm produces a **development version** (e.g. `0.1.5.dev3`), not `0.1.4`. To release `0.1.5`, create and push the tag `v0.1.5`; CI will then build and publish that version to PyPI.

### Running Tests

```bash
pytest
```

### CI/CD Pipeline

This project uses GitHub Actions for automated testing and publishing:

- **Tests run automatically** on every push and pull request
- **Publishing to PyPI** happens automatically when:
  - All tests pass ✅
  - Push is to `main`/`master` branch or a version tag (e.g., `v0.1.0`)

See [.github/workflows/README.md](.github/workflows/README.md) for detailed setup instructions.

## Mathematical Background

### Compression Techniques Used

LoPace uses the following compression techniques:

![Compression techniques](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/connectaman/LoPace/main/screenshots/lopace-compression-technique.png)

1. **LZ77 (Sliding Window)**: Used **indirectly** through Zstandard
   - Zstandard internally uses LZ77-style algorithms to find repeated patterns
   - Instead of storing "assistant" again, it stores a tuple: (distance_back, length)
   - We use this by calling `zstandard.compress()` - the LZ77 is handled internally

2. **Huffman Coding / FSE (Finite State Entropy)**: Used **indirectly** through Zstandard
   - Zstandard uses FSE, a variant of Huffman coding
   - Assigns shorter binary codes to characters/patterns that appear most frequently
   - Again, handled internally by the zstandard library

3. **BPE Tokenization**: Used **directly** via tiktoken
   - Byte-Pair Encoding converts text to token IDs
   - Reduces vocabulary size before compression
   - Implemented by OpenAI's tiktoken library

### Shannon Entropy

The theoretical compression limit is determined by Shannon Entropy:

$H(X) = -\sum_{i=1}^{n} P(x_i) \log_2 P(x_i)$

Where:
- $H(X)$ is the entropy of the source
- $P(x_i)$ is the probability of character/pattern $x_i$

LoPace **calculates** Shannon Entropy to show theoretical compression limits:

```python
compressor = PromptCompressor()
entropy = compressor.calculate_shannon_entropy("Your prompt")
limits = compressor.get_theoretical_compression_limit("Your prompt")
print(f"Theoretical minimum: {limits['theoretical_min_bytes']:.2f} bytes")
```

This allows you to compare actual compression against the theoretical limit.
